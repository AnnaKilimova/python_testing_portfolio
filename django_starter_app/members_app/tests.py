    Description:
        This class tests that the Member model behaves correctly when creating
        new model instances and when converting them to strings.

    Steps performed:
        - Create Member objects and verify that fields are saved correctly.
        - Check that the `joined_at` field is automatically generated.
        - Verify that the `__str__()` method returns the model first_name.

    Notes:
        The tests use Django's built-in `TestCase`, which creates a temporary
        database for each test run. This ensures that tests do not affect
        real project data.

    def test_valid_form(self):
        """Test that MemberForm accepts valid data.

        Steps:
            1. Create a dictionary called `data` that simulates data
               submitted from a web form. The keys correspond to the
               model fields listed in MemberForm.Meta.fields:
               'first_name', 'last_name' and 'email'.
            2. Provide values in the correct formats. For email,
               Django expects the email address validator, 'something@something.something'.
            3. Pass this dictionary to `MemberForm(data=data)`, which
               creates a bound form (a form connected to data).
            4. Call `form.is_valid()` to trigger Django's validation process.
               - If all fields are valid, it returns True and populates
                 the `cleaned_data` dictionary.
            5. Use `self.assertTrue(form.is_valid())` to confirm that
               the form correctly validates when all input is proper.

        Notes:
            - `MemberForm` is a subclass of `forms.ModelForm`.
              It automatically creates form fields based on the Member model.
            - The validation process checks data types, required fields,

               a bound form instance.

        Notes:
            - By default, Django's `EmailField` expects the email address validator, 
              'something@something.something'. If a different format like 'something@something'
              should be accepted, you can define `input_formats` in

        - resolve(): takes a URL path and determines which view function
          should handle it.

    Description:
        This test checks if the Member model is properly registered in the Django admin interface.
        Registering a model in admin.py allows administrators to manage Member objects
        (add, edit, delete, or view them) through the Django admin panel.

        The test uses Django's built-in admin.site._registry attribute, which stores
        all models that have been registered with the admin site. If a model is missing
        from this registry, it means it won't appear in the admin dashboard.

    Steps:
        1. Import the Member model and the global admin site object.
        2. Use the assertIn() method to check whether the Member model
           exists in admin.site._registry.
        3. If it is registered correctly, the test will pass; if not, it will fail.

    Notes:
        - This test does not interact with the database directly.
        - It only verifies that admin.py includes a line such as:
              admin.site.register(Member)
